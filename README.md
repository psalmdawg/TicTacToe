Tic Tac Toe Game... You know the rules

Player 'x' starts and the players play to five rounds. Trying to position their pieces in a winning combination on the board. 
first to five rounds wins, and the game will need to be reset(using the reset button). Each new round will be started by pressing the 'next round'button.



this game was made using JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

The main 'brain' of the game was based on an 'object', and each cell on the tic tac toe board related to a key in the object.
Changing the object values with the 'event.listener' function proved to be tricky, but worked nicely when I worked it out,  als to identify winning combinations also proved to be difficult. 
To determine a win or draw, I  settled on a very unsatisfactory method of hard coding every single winning combination for both the "O" and the "X". It took up a lot of lines, and I hope to return to code and improve on this. 

Apart from that, I am happy with the look and feel of the game.
There is one known bug, which occurs when the player continue to tap the board after he/she has one. the scores continue to log upwards.

Cheers!
