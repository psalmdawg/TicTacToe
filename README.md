Tic Tac Toe Game... You know the rules

player x starts and the players play to five rounds. Trying to position their pieces in a winning combination on the board. 
first to five rounds wins, and the game will need to be reset(using the reset button). Each new round will be started by pressing the 'next round'
button.



this game was made using JavaScript and HTML.

The main 'brain' of the game was based on an object and each cell on the tic tac toe board related to a key in the object.
changing the object values with the event.listener proved to be tricky, and to identify winning combinations also proved to be difficult. 
I settled on a very unsatisfactory method of hard coding every single winning combination for both the "O" and the "X". it took up a lot of lines, and I hope to return to 
code and improve on this. 
Apart from that, I am happy with the look and feel of the game.
There is one know bug, which occurs when the player continue to tap the board after he/she has one. the scores continue to log upwards.

Cheers!
